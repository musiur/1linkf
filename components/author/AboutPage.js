            How My Work Will Benefit You
          </h1>
          <p>
            {"I'm"} an advocate for useful ideas. The central question I explore
            through my work is, “How can we live better?”
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, I want to find great ideas and explain them in a way
            that is easy to use and apply to daily life.
          </p>
          <p>My writing focuses on topics like…</p>
          <p>
            How to start (and stick to) good habits How to make good choices and
            avoid bad ones How to accomplish more in less time How to create
            better systems and processes How to achieve meaningful results
            without overwhelming yourself
