            For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s,
            they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph
            onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the
            image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses.
            This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time
            consuming and expensive.
